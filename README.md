# Governed Information Acquisition Instruments (GIAI) 

**Governed Information Acquisition Instruments** (**GIAI**) is an opinionated approach to managing
information acquisition instruments such as human-powered surveys as forms as well as machine-powered
data collection systems.

GIAI uses [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) as the core configuration language and generates appropriate
NIH LHC Form and related artifacts.

The GIAI is designed to specify, in a form-engine and orchestration agnostic approach, complex
validatable data acquisition systems. It's based on a "specify once, generate many" design philosophy.
