# Governed Information Acquisition Instruments (GIAI) 

A "survey instrument" is a tool for obtaining data from respondents. **Governed
Information Acquisition Instruments** (**GIAI**) is an opinionated approach to
managing information acquisition instruments such as human-powered surveys as
web forms as well as machine-powered data collection systems.

GIAI uses [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) as the core configuration 
language and generates appropriate NIH LHC Form and related artifacts.

The GIAI is designed to specify, in a form-engine and orchestration agnostic approach, complex
validatable data acquisition systems. It's based on a "specify once, generate many" design philosophy.
